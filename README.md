# Streaming-Servises-Management-System

This repository contains a Java-based application designed to manage various aspects of streaming services. The system allows users to handle movie and series information, manage actors and their details, track subscriptions, and perform various operations related to streaming services.

### Features

- Movie and Series Management: Add, edit, and view details of movies and series.
- Actor and Cast Management: Manage information about actors and cast members associated with movies and series.
- Subscription Management: Handle subscriber details and their subscriptions to different streaming services.
- Purchasing and Pricing: Manage purchase records and calculate total prices for services.
- User Interface: A graphical user interface (GUI) for easy interaction with the application.

### Future Development

I plan to develop this project further to make the movies watchable directly within the application. Stay tuned for updates!

### Project Structure

- src/StreamingServices: Contains the source code for the application, including classes for movies, series, actors, subscriptions, and the main GUI.
